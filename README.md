# compass-docker

If you need to use compass, but don't want to install Ruby and friends
and already use Node.js, this is a drop-in replacement that will launch
compass in Docker.

Requirements:

* Node.js installed
* Docker installed
* You can run `docker` commands without sudo

Installation:

Windows:

$ npm install -g https://github.com/gabrys/compass-docker.git


Mac/Linux:

$ sudo npm install -g https://github.com/gabrys/compass-docker.git

or

$ sudo yarn global add https://github.com/gabrys/compass-docker.git

Usage (same as https://rubygems.org/gems/compass):

$ compass
